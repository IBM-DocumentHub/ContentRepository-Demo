First let's understand what are HTML tags.

* In simple words, HTML tags are keywords that are known to a browser.

* Based on the keyword, browser displays the format of the content.

* Tags are surrounded by angular brackets. Every tag comes in pair; a start tag also known as an opening tag and its corresponding end tag also known as closing tag.

* Example `<head>` is the start tag and `</head>` is its corresponding end tag. Here you can notice that the end tag must have the same text, but must be preceeded by a forward slash **"/"**.

* Every tag need not have a corresponding end tag. The `img` tag which is used to display the images does not have an end tag.

* Tags also have their own set of attributes. Example `<img src="/home/pictures/my_image.png">`. Here `src` is an attribute of the `<img>` tag which specifies the path of the image file.

Now let's understand what are HTML elements.

* HTML elements are combination of a tag alongwith its content.

* Example `<p> HelloWorld </p>` is an element which consists of a start tag `<p>`, the content `HelloWorld` and `</p>` which forms the end tag. Depending upon these tags, browser displays the content.


HTML5 has got many tags. Let's go through few of them.
