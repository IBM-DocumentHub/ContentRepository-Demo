HTML stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**. HTML is mainly used to create web pages. Every web page you see, is HTML alongwith CSS (Cascaded Style Sheets) which is used to make the page more appealing. How the web page should look and the alignment of various pieces of a web page is all described by HTML. It tells the browser how these pieces should be aligned with respect to each other and displayed. HTML document consists of various elements and every element is made up of tags. These tags are not displayed on the browser screen; only the content inside the tag is displayed with effect corresponding to the tag used. Every HTML file is stored using a `.html` extension. The latest version of HTML is HTML5.

A simple HTML document.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Hello World!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Let's understand the code.
* Every HTML document begins with `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This declaration defines the type of document. Here the declaration specifies the document to be HTML5.

* The `<html>` element is the root of the page.

* `<head>` element consists of the metadata related to page.

* `<title>` specifies a title for the document.

* `<body>` consists of the elements displayed on the browser screen.

* `<p>` defines a paragraph.

Note that the indentation in code is not necessary. But it's better to indent the code for better readability.

Now let's understand what are HTML tags and elements.
